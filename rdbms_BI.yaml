      # Analytics RDBMS and BI Curation DP

      This data product provides access to core analytics RDBMS tables
      including:

      **RDBMS Catalog Objects:**
      - **rdbms_datasources**: Data source connections and configuration
      - **rdbms_schemas**: Database schemas and containers
      - **rdbms_tables**: Relational database table metadata and structure
      - **rdbms_columns**: Column/attribute definitions and properties

      **Custom Fields & Governance:**
      - **customfieldvalue**: Custom fields linking catalog objects to users, groups, policies, terms/documents or other entities

      **User & Access Management:**
      - **users**: User account information and profiles
      - **alation_group**: Group definitions and metadata
      - **user_group_membership**: Relationships between users and groups

      **Governance Objects:**
      - **business_policy**: Policies information
      - **terms**: Glossary term / Document information
      - **glossaries**: Glossary/folder containers and hierarchies
      - **article**: Articles and documentation

      This data product also provides insights into your Business Intelligence ecosystem. 
      It encompasses information about BI servers, data sources, reports, folders, and
      connection details, enabling deep analysis of your BI infrastructure and
      usage patterns. With this data product, you can explore report structures,
      data lineage, and user interactions to optimize your BI strategy and
      improve decision-making processes.



      Example questions that can be answered using SQL:

      1. What are the most frequently used data sources across all BI reports?
      2. How many reports are contained within each folder, and what is the
      folder hierarchy?
      3. What is the distribution of report types (simple vs. dashboard) in our
      BI environment?
      4. Which BI reports have the most complex data transformations based on
      connection column count?
      5. How has the number of BI reports and data sources grown over time?

    customfieldvalue:
      name: customfieldvalue
      displayName: Custom Field Values
      description: |
        Each row represents a specific custom field value assigned to a catalog object.
        This table acts as a flexible junction connecting catalog objects (tables, schemas, datasources, etc.)
        to various entities through custom fields (users, groups, policies, terms, etc.).

        Key concepts:
        - Use object_id + object_type to identify which catalog object has the custom field
        - field_type determines which value column to read (field_value_text vs field_value_array)
        - Array values use entity prefixes (e.g., 'user_123', 'groupprofile_456') for references
        - GIN index on field_value_array enables efficient containment queries (@> operator)
      schema:
        - name: object_id
          displayName: Object ID
          description: |
            Unique identifier of the catalog object to which the custom field value applies.
            

            This ID corresponds to the primary identifier of objects in different tables:
            - For object_type='table': links to rdbms_tables.table_id
            - For object_type='schema': links to schema_id in respective table
            - For object_type='data': links to datasource_id
            - For object_type='attribute': links to column_id
            - And so on for other object types

            Always use in combination with object_type to identify the catalog object.
          type: numeric
        - name: object_type
          displayName: Object Type
          description: |
            Type of the catalog object to which this custom field applies.
            

            **Prominent object_type values** (most commonly used):
            - 'data' = Datasource (database connection)
            - 'schema' = Database schema
            - 'table' = Table or view

            **Used by these field_type values:**
            - TEXT: Plain text values
            - RICH_TEXT: HTML-formatted text
            - DATE: Date values (stored as text, format: 'YYYY-MM-DD')

          description: |
            Stores the custom field value(s) for array-based field types.
            

            **Used by these field_type values:**
            - OBJECT_SET: References to other catalog objects (with entity prefixes)
            - MULTI_PICKER: Multiple selection from predefined options
            - PICKER: Single selection from predefined options (stored as single-element array)

            **Entity prefix mapping for OBJECT_SET references:**
            Array elements are prefixed with entity type followed by underscore and ID:
            - 'user_<id>' = User (e.g., 'user_123')
            - 'groupprofile_<id>' = Group (e.g., 'groupprofile_456')
            - 'business_policy_<id>' = Business Policy (e.g., 'business_policy_789')
            - 'glossary_term_<id>' = Term/Document (e.g., 'glossary_term_101')
            - 'glossary_v3_<id>' = Glossary/Folder (e.g., 'glossary_v3_202')
            - 'article_<id>' = Article (e.g., 'article_303')
            - 'data_<id>' = Datasource (e.g., 'data_12')
            - 'schema_<id>' = Schema (e.g., 'schema_34')
            - 'table_<id>' = Table (e.g., 'table_567')
            - 'attribute_<id>' = Column (e.g., 'attribute_890')

            **For PICKER/MULTI_PICKER (non-OBJECT_SET):**
            Array contains plain string values without prefixes (e.g., ['Yes'], ['No'], ['Option1', 'Option2']).

            **Query tips:**
            - Use PostgreSQL's @> operator for containment checks: field_value_array @> ARRAY['user_123']
            - GIN index on this column enables efficient array queries
            - Extract ID from prefixed values using split or regex functions

            This column is NULL when field_type is TEXT, RICH_TEXT, DATE, or FLAG
            (those use field_value_text instead).

            Examples: 'technical owner', 'data steward', 'applicable policies', 'PII classification'

            **Important notes:**
            - Field names are user-defined and can vary between Alation instances
            - Use case-insensitive matching with ILIKE for robustness
            - Common patterns: ownership fields often contain 'owner' or 'steward'
            - Policy fields often contain 'policy' or 'policies'
            - Classification fields often contain 'classification', 'sensitivity', 'tier'

            **Query tip:** Use `field_name ILIKE '%owner%'` for flexible pattern matching.

            - **OBJECT_SET**: References to catalog objects with entity prefixes (stored in field_value_array)

            **Value storage mapping:**
            - field_value_text used by: TEXT, RICH_TEXT, DATE, FLAG
            - field_value_array used by: PICKER, MULTI_PICKER, OBJECT_SET
